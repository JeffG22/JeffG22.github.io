I am about to complete my Master's in Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/) with a specialization in Theoretical Computer Science. My research interests are in the design and analysis of algorithms, with a focus on modern computational settings, such as distributed, online, parallel, and sublinear algorithms. I wish to continue with a PhD in this field. 

I am currently a research intern at Amazon in Luxembourg working on combinatorial optimization problems. Prior to that, I conducted my Master's thesis in the group of [Mohsen Ghaffari](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ghaffari/) working with [Manuela Fischer](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/fiscmanu/) and [Christoph Grunau](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/cgrunau/). In 2021, I did a research internship at the [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) hosted by [Andreas Karrenbauer](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~karrenba/). I formerly interned at Meta and Amazon as a software engineer.
 
In 2019, I graduated summa cum laude from the [University of Genoa](https://unige.it/en/) with a BS in Computer Science and Engineering.

Since August 2021, I am serving as Lead of the [Google Developer Student Club Zurich](https://gdsc.community.dev/eth-zurich/), a community group of over 1100 students around science and technology. Read more about my journey [in this article](https://medium.com/googledeveloperseurope/gdsc-z%C3%BCrich-leads-build-community-around-cutting-edge-tech-topics-411d3dc7b11b).
